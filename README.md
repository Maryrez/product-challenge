# Challenge

As a Product Manager that just joined the team, one of your tasks is to write the user stories that will guide the development team in building the product.

The design team and the product manager collaborated to create the wireframes that you'll use as a base to write the user stories. Your task is to describe all possible scenarios involving the sign-in and sign-up pages. For each interaction, you need to write a scenario that tells the user's story and how the interface should behave.

To better understand the screens you should describe, you can revisit the conversation between the designer and the product manager who created the wireframes.
